Developed a Streamlit web application that scrapes and aggregates BFSI-related press releases and quarterly earnings from leading IT companies (Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCLTech, etc.) using Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and PDF parsing. Deployed on Render with automated Chrome setup for cloud execution.
